# JSON Schema Viewer

JSON Schema viewer is a lightweight library and tool in JavaScript to turn a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) into nice human-readable documents that you publish or embed in HTML or MarkDown.

It is designed for use in rendering documentation for metadata and data schemas for data management systems like [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan) â€” though it can be used for any JSON Schema.

## Install

Requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12+:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm link
```

## Usage

### API

To convert [`input.json`](test/fixtures/input.json) into [`output.md`](test/fixtures/output.md), we need to read the content of the input file pass it to the `toMarkDown` function. For example, the following function would return the contents of `output.md` when called with the contents of `input.json`:

```javascript
async function convert(path) {
  const input = await fs.promises.readFile(path, "utf8");
  return toMarkDown(input);
}
```

### CLI (to be implemented)

```console
$ jsv --help
Usage: jsv [options] <URL> <OUTPUT>

jsv (JSON Scheme Viewer)

JSON Schema viewer is a lightweight javascript library and tool that turns JSON
schemas into a elegant human readable documents.

It expects URL to be a location of a JSON scheme file, and it decides the
format of the output based on the file extension of OUTPUT (which is created
as a result) or the format provided via the --output option.

Options:
  -V, --version      output the version number
  --output=<output>  Format of the output file.
  --css=<css>        URL of a CSS stylesheet (to be included in HTML outputs).
  --embed-css        Include the contents of the CSS in the HTML output.
  --stdout           No output file is created and the result goes to stdout.
  -h, --help         display help for command
```
